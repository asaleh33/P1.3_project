# P1.3_project:  Advanced Programming

## Lecturer: Alberto  Sartori



## Python part

In the Python part of the project, we were asked to write a class *PostcardList*  that manges the I/O file through six member functions, such as `writeFile(self,...)`, `readFile(self,...)`,  parsePostcards(self,...), ... etc.  The class *PostcardList* sorts data based on the input parameters (date, senders, receivers). This process is manged using three member functions; getPostcardsByDateRange(self,date_range), getPostcardsBySender(self, sender), and getPostcardsByReceiver(self, receiver).  The class is build up in the [exam_solution](./exam_solution.py) script, which is called by the [exam_requests](./exam_requests.py).
